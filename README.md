# MDN-basics

So, I have been swinging from one tutorial to the next, pausing the video to try and guess what the teacher is going to code next and why they would use it.

This has been good so far BUT I feel that there are a lot of gaps to be filled. This repo will be about that. Some of the stuff like h1-h6 I know but other things like meta charset=utf-8 is obvious to some but I haven't heard of it until today.

I intend to use MDN Web Docs from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript?fbclid=IwAR3q0b7XTtguADLG3N_HxDVR_fh_ItCG_Po-EtP_V5vMKaixVzAk-Bu47Gg to bridge the gaps.
